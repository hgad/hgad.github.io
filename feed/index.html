  <p>Writing turns vague thoughts into tangible ideas. It often occurs that I think I understand some idea; but it’s not until I’m asked to express it that I find myself incapable of clearly formulating it. You cannot write down your thoughts until you’ve reached a level of understanding that allows you to express them with enough precision.</p>
<p>Moreover, I find it easier to judge an idea and turn it over in my head when I see it written down. Reading my own insights helps me spot the fallacies, fix the misconceptions and establish connections with other ideas.</p>
<p>Another advantage of recording insights (especially in a digital format), is that it’s easier to recall answers to questions which tend to crop up every once in a while.</p>
<p>Sharing my thoughts with others makes them subject to further scrutiny. The feedback I get from others helps me perfect some ideas and rethink others.</p>
<p>I’ve been meaning to start this blog for quite some time, but was too lazy to get the show on the road. I was finally able to set aside some time and get it done. Hope you find my insights interesting, useful, or at least entertaining!</p>
